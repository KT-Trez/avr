# AudioVideo Ripper
An Electron-based application designed to facilitate video downloads from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Download  
To download the app, visit the [releases](https://github.com/KT-Trez/YouTube-Downloader/releases) page and choose the appropriate installer.  

> [!WARNING]  
> The `Advanced download` feature utilizes [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to merge audio and video, a process that is CPU-intensive.  
> Keep this in mind when downloading multiple videos simultaneously or using lower-end computers and laptops.  
>  
> Additionally, merging may not always be perfect, and slight audio-video desynchronization can occur.
